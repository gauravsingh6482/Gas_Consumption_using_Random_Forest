Gas_Consumption_using_Random_Forest


The problem here is to predict the gas consumption (in millions of gallons) in 48 of the US states based on petrol tax (in cents), per capita income (dollars), paved highways (in miles) and the proportion of population with the driving license.

To solve this regression problem we will use the random forest algorithm via the Scikit-Learn Python library. We will follow the traditional machine learning pipeline to solve this problem. Follow these steps:
